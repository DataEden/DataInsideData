# 📊 DataInsideData

Welcome to **DataInsideData** – a hands-on repository exploring the powerful intersection of **AI engineering**, **data workflows**, and **real-world automation**.

This project space serves as a digital lab for testing and building intelligent systems, starting with an AI agent that generates financial news articles from public SEC filings.

---

## 🚀 Current Project: Automated Financial News Agent

In this tutorial-based project, we're building an intelligent AI agent that:

- Pulls real-time SEC filings from major companies (e.g., NVIDIA)
- Extracts key information
- Auto-generates readable news articles using AI (e.g., LLMs like GPT)
- Can be scaled into a full-fledged financial news automation pipeline

> 💡 This is a practical introduction to AI Engineering — using data to create value at scale.

## 🧠 Why This Project Matters

- 📈 Real-world AI implementation (not just theory)
- 🧰 Practice with APIs, LLMs, and automation
- 💼 Career prep for AI/Data/Automation roles

---

## 🧰 Tools & Tech

- Python
- OpenAI / Hugging Face (LLMs)
- SEC EDGAR API
- BeautifulSoup or LangChain
- Markdown + Git/GitHub
- FastAPI or Streamlit for serving output

---

## 📚 Learning Goals

- Master AI agent pipelines
- Learn to extract structured insights from unstructured data
- Deploy automation that runs "passively" for value creation
- Build confidence in data-driven storytelling and software development

---

## ✨ What’s Next

- 🔄 Add `.ipynb` notebooks for agent building
- 🗂 Create `src/` for reusable modules
- 📈 Include `README`s for future subprojects like dashboards or data visualizations
